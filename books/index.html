                <h2>Vicariously</h2>
                <p>Thanks to her dad’s part-time work as a ski pro, seventeen-year-old Beck has never had to live in the
                    Tubes: coffin-sized pods where tech lets the poor vicariously experience government-produced reality
                    shows in all five senses. Beck wants more than just to stay out of the Tubes, though. She wants to
                    get herself and her dad back to the life of luxury (and happiness…) they once led. Jobs are scarce,
                    so when she blows her only tryout and discovers her dad is about to lose his house, her dreams of a
                    better life are over—until an old family friend gives her the chance to try out for a snowboarding
                    reality show.</p>
                <p>She jumps at the opportunity, against her father’s wishes, since auditioning requires expensive tech
                    upgrades that will leave her penniless in a pod if she fails, spending her days living the reality
                    shows she’d hoped to create. She’ll have to build a huge following to have a shot at landing the
                    gig, though, and on-screen romances are the easiest way to go viral. Beck intends to get her first
                    kiss out of the way at the tryouts, but childhood friend and rival snowboarder Ash keeps getting in
                    the way. Their agent suggests they start a fake flirtation, but soon Beck isn’t sure their chemistry
                    is all for the audience, after all.</p>
                <p>The closer Beck gets to a contract, the more she questions how real her new life will be and whether
                    having the money to keep herself and her father out of the Tubes is worth being part of the system
                    that keeps so many others in them.</p>
