                <h2>Vicariously</h2>
                <p>In near-future California, jobs are scarce and unemployed masses spend their days in government
                    housing: coffin-sized pods where tech lets them experience government-produced reality shows in five
                    senses. New grad Beck Fiore wants to live life for herself, though—ad-free and in the flesh—and keep
                    her underemployed ski pro dad out of the pods at any cost. </p>
                <p>Beck thinks her dream is shot when she blows her only job prospect and discovers her dad is about to
                    lose his house. When an old family friend gets Beckher the chance to try out for a snowboarding
                    reality show, she jumps at it—even though auditioning requires expensive tech upgrades that will
                    leave her penniless in a pod if she fails. She’ll have to build a huge following to have a shot at
                    landing the gig, and on-screen romances are the easiest way to do that., Butso when she reconnects
                    with childhood friend and rival snowboarder Ash at the tryouts, she can’t tell if their chemistry is
                    real or all for the audience—a question that only grows when they start fake-dating at the
                    suggestion of their agent. </p>
                <p>The closer Beck gets to a contract, though, the more she questions how real her new life will be and
                    whether having money to save herself and her father is worth being part of the system she’s saving
                    them from.</p>
